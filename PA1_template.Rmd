unzip("activity.zip")
activity = read.csv("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
activity$hour <- activity$interval %/% 100
activity$minute <- activity$interval - (activity$hour * 100)
activity$time <- activity$hour * 60 * 60 + activity$minute * 60
activity$time <- hms::as.hms(activity$time)
activity$date_time <- as.POSIXct(paste(activity$date, activity$time), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

View(activity)
```
